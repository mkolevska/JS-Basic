    <h1>Task 5: The Farm Problem</h1>
    <p>In this challenge, a farmer is asking you to tell him how many legs can be counted among all his animals. The farmer breeds three species:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>chickens = 2 legs</li>
        <li>cows = 4 legs</li>
        <li>pigs = 4 legs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The farmer has counted his animals and he gives you a subtotal for each species. You have to implement a function that returns the total number of legs of all the animals.</p>
