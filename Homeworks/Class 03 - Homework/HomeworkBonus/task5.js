// In this challenge, a farmer is asking you to tell him how many legs can be counted among all his animals. The farmer breeds three species:

// chickens = 2 legs
// cows = 4 legs
// pigs = 4 legs
// The farmer has counted his animals and he gives you a subtotal for each species. You have to implement a function that returns the total number of legs of all the animals.

function animalLegs(chickens, cows, pigs) {
    if (Number.isNaN(chickens) || chickens < 0 || Number.isNaN(cows) || cows < 0 || Number.isNaN(pigs) || pigs < 0) {
        return "Enter valid values";
    }
    let chickensLegs = chickens * 2;
    let cowsLegs = cows * 4;
    let pigsLegs = pigs * 4;
    return `The total number of legs of the animals is: ${chickensLegs + cowsLegs + pigsLegs}`
}

let chickens = parseInt(prompt("Enter the number of chickens:"));
let cows = parseInt(prompt("Enter the numbers of cows:"));
let pigs = parseInt(prompt("Enter the number of pigs:"))

let result = animalLegs(chickens, cows, pigs)
console.log(result)
